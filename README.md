![alt text](https://www.luiztools.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CRUD.png)

Create, Read, Update, and Delete are the four functions that models should be able to do. Looking to improve the php language this crud was made.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
 
* PHP v8.0.8  - [Download & Install PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)a
* Apache  - [Download & Install Apache](https://downloads.apache.org/)

## How to use

The project has been separated into folders with the respective CRUD functions. So to use you will start the local server in the browser with the folder name. 

Example:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/index.php 
```
